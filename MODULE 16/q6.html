    <h2 class="subtitle">How to Make Your Text Look Great on Any Device</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
      Typography is an essential part of web design that impacts readability, engagement, and the overall user experience.
      By carefully selecting fonts and adjusting line heights and spacing, you can ensure your content is pleasant to read 
      on any screen size. Responsive typography uses CSS techniques to adapt text size and layout fluidly.

      Using web-safe or custom web fonts like those from Google Fonts allows greater creativity while maintaining performance.
      It is important to balance style with legibility, especially on smaller mobile devices. Adjusting font sizes with viewport
      units or media queries helps achieve this balance.
